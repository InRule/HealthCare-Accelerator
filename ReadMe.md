#Healthcare Eligibility Accelerator
This rule application demonstrates the basic strategies and patters for determining healthcare and Medicaid eligibility. It contains the following capabilities.
* The Healthcare Accelerator application provides an annotated schema based on the Health Insurance Marketplace Application for Health Coverage & Help Paying Costs (Form OMB No. 0938-1191). 
* This application provides an example of modeling the business process integral for a Medicaid eligibility determination.
* Performs basic application validation.
* Checks verifications including citizenship, alienage, SSN, and income verification.
* Calculates household size using both MAGI and relationship-based models.
* Calculates countable income and deductions based on the household calculation used.
* Determines program eligibility for pregnancy-related services, child health program and the Medicaid expansion populations.
To test the rule application, there are included three scenarios with sample test data. This will need to be tested in the context of the Application entity and can be tested in irVerify once the test data is loaded by using the Apply Rules button. We have three scenarios avialble. One for a single pregnant applicant who is eligible for services, a family needing additional verification, and one demonstrating housheholding calculations by relationship.
## Important NOTE 
Medicaid rules vary by state and this application is not considered to be completely comprehensive but serve as a model on how public service program eligibility determinations could be developed and architected. This application is intended to serve as a reference and an accelerator for project development.
